This app transmits sound recorded from microphone to other devices
running the same app on the same network, so works like Walkie Talkie radio.

Devices find each other by Android NSD (i.e. Bonjour), no any configuration required.
Audio data is being transmitted by the unicast channel (TCP/IP).
So each device works as a server and as a client at the same time.
